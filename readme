	Python Cheatsheet
=> What is Python?  
- Python is a stand-alone programming language.  
- It is easy to learn, with a simple and readable syntax.  
- Python is versatile, allowing you to build almost anything.  

=>Python Can Be Used For:  
1. Web Applications- Frameworks like Flask, Django.  
2. Applications - Libraries like Kivy.  
3. Data Science - Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  
4. Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence - TensorFlow, PyTorch.  
5. Desktop Applications - Tkinter, PyQt.  
6. Game Development - Pygame.  
7. Automation & Scripting - Useful for repetitive tasks.  

=>Basic Concepts  

1. print()- Used to display output on the terminal.  
   
   print("Hello, World!")
   

2. input() - Used to take user input from the terminal.  
  
   name = input("Enter your name: ")
   print(f"Hello, {name}")
   

3. Variables - Containers used to store data.  
   Rules for Naming Variables:  
   - No spaces in variable names (e.g., use `my_variable`, not `my variable`).  
   - Must not use Python keywords (e.g., 'if', 'for', `while`).  
   - Cannot start with a number or special characters (e.g., `1variable` is invalid).  
	Data Types  

1. Strings - Characters enclosed in quotation marks (`" "` or `' '`).  
   Example: "Hello", 'Python'.  

2. Integers - Numeric values without a decimal point.  
   Example: 42, 100.  

3. Floats - Numeric values with decimal points.  
   Example: `3.14`, `0.99`.  

4. Booleans - Represent `True` or `False`.  

=> Data Structures  

1. Lists  
   - Used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
   - Enclosed in square brackets: `[ ]`.  
   - Mutable (can be changed).  
   Example:  
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   fruits[0] = "orange"  # Changing an item
   

2. Tuples 
   - Used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
   - Enclosed in parentheses: `( )`.  
   - Immutable(cannot be changed).  
   Example:
   coordinates = (10, 20, 30)


3. Sets  
   - Store unique items in curly braces: `{ }`.  
   Example:
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}


4. Dictionaries 
   - Store data in key-value pairs.  
   - Enclosed in curly braces: `{key: value}`.  
   Example:
   student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 21}

 => Operators  

1. Arithmetic Operators 
   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulus), `**` (exponentiation), `//` (floor division).  

2.Assignment Operators 
   - `=` (assignment), `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.  

3. Comparison Operators 
   - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal).  

4. Logical Operators
   - `and`, `or`, `not`.  

5. Membership Operators
   - `in`, `not in` (check if an item exists in a sequence).  

	Conditional Statements  

Used to execute code based on conditions.  

1. if Statement  
   Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.  
   
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are an adult")
   

2. else Statement 
   Executes a block of code if the condition is `False`.  

3. elif (Else If) 
   Used for multiple conditions with different outcomes.  

4. Nested if Statements
   `if` statements inside other `if` statements.  

=> Loops  

Used to perform repetitive tasks.  

1. For Loops  
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)

2. While Loops 
   i = 0
   while i < 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1
   

3. Control Statements:  
   - `break`: Exit the loop early.  
   - `continue`: Skip to the next iteration.  

=> Functions  

A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.  

Syntax:  
def function_name(parameters):
     block of code
    return output

Example:  
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  Output: 8

=>Classes & Objects  

Classes are blueprints for creating objects.  

Syntax:  
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

Creating an object
student1 = Student("Alice", 21)
print(student1.name)  Output: Alice

Key Points:  
- A class contains attributes (variables) and methods (functions).  
- `__init__()` is a special method used to initialize attributes.  


=>	Additional Points To Read  

1. Modules & Libraries 
   - Python comes with built-in modules like `math`, `random`.  
   - You can install external libraries using `pip`.  

2. Error Handling  
   - Use `try...except` to handle exceptions.  
	example
   try:
       result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero!")


3. File Handling 
   - Open, read, write, and close files.  
	example
   with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write("Hello, Python!")


4. Python Comprehensions 
   - Compact ways to create lists, dictionaries, etc.  
   example
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

This covers most of the essential points about Python.
